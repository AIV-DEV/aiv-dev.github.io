Multi APK Tool extracts and repacks multiple APK files at once.

As a ROM developer, Iâ€™ve often needed to edit a large amount of APK files.
I usually use APK easy tool or MT Manager, but they are can't edit multiple APK files.
beacuse of that, I'm writing a CMD script that can do it. 
This is not an elegant solution; it runs the same commands over and over 30 times.
But it is useful :)
I hope later to make it really efficient...

**Update 16.01.2024**

 I decided to consolidate my scripts into one project, [Cobalt Scripts](https://github.com/AshiVered/Cobalt-Scripts).
This script also moved there, and give it a new name.
[Cobalt ApkTool](https://github.com/AshiVered/Cobalt-Scripts/tree/main/Cobalt-ApkTool).
